Terraform Poke Provider

The Terraform Poke Provider started as a creative experiment to show that Infrastructure as Code doesn’t always need to stay within traditional boundaries.

What is it about?

Terraform Poke Provider allows you to manage Pokémon as infrastructure resources using Terraform. While the concept may sound playful, the underlying goal is clear: to explore how Terraform, Go, external APIs, and complementary Python applications can work together, and to showcase how DevOps tools can be extended for unconventional use cases.

Key Features

Custom Terraform provider in Go to extend IaC capabilities.

API integrations to manage and fetch external resources.

Flask (Python) web application as a complementary interface.

Dockerized deployment for packaging and portability.

Project Structure

terraform-poke-provider/: Terraform provider source code in Go.

app/: Python Flask web app.

main.tf: Example Terraform configuration.

dockerfile: Container for deployment.

Philosophy Behind the Project

Beyond the fun idea of running terraform apply to define your own Pokémon team, this project demonstrates how custom Terraform providers work, how to integrate them with APIs, and how to expand the “as Code” philosophy into new and unconventional scenarios.
